# PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING

## Thanks for checking out Minecraftathome-stats

#### TO RUN THE SCRIPT YOU MUST DO THESE STEPS:
* Make sure you are downloading the files from the master branch. -=Not any other tags=-
* Install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) by clicking on 'Download Python {version}'
* AFTER installing Python, open cmd and write these next 2 commands: "pip3 install requests" and "pip3 install bs4", and wait for them to be installed
* Download all the files from the master branch and in case they are in a .zip file, please extract them anywhere. {NOT DOING THIS WILL GIVE AN ERROR WHEN RUNNING THE SCRIPT}
* And you are done, just run the .bat file and the script should be running well.
* If it's your first time oppening the script, you will need to restart it after you see the message. This is done because I can't put blank files on github.
