# Thanks for checking out Minecraftathome-stats

#### TO RUN THE SCRIPT YOU MUST DO THE FOLLOWING:
* Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ by clicking on 'Download Python {version}'
* AFTER installing Python, open cmd and write these next 2 commands: "pip3 install requests" and "pip3 install bs4", and wait for them to be installed
* And you are done, just run the .bat file and the script should be running well.
* If it's your first time oppening the script, you will need to restart it after you see the message. This is done because I can't put blank files on github.

Hello, thanks for installing my little python script made for checking Minecraft at home credits/recent average credits for an user.
