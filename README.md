# Minecraftathome-stats

Hello, thanks for installing my little python script for checking Minecraft at home credits/recent average
credits for an user. What you need to do is open the MC@HomeStats bat file which will run the python file
which is in this same folder. You are going to need python installed on your pc. If you don't have it
installed, go to this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/ and click on "Download Python [version]"
